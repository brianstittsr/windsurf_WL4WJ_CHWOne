# Fixing Firebase Permissions Error

If you're seeing a "Missing or insufficient permissions" error in your CHWOne application, follow these steps to resolve it:

## Understanding the Error

This error occurs when your Firebase security rules are too restrictive for the operations your application is trying to perform. During development, it's common to use more permissive rules to make testing easier.

## Solution 1: Deploy the Development Rules

We've created a set of development-friendly security rules that allow all read/write operations. These are suitable for development but **should not be used in production**.

To deploy these rules:

1. Make sure you're logged in to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

2. Run the deploy-rules script:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-rules
   ```

This will deploy the permissive rules in `firestore.rules` to your Firebase project.

## Solution 2: Use Firebase Emulator

For local development, you can use the Firebase emulator suite which doesn't enforce security rules:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

Then update your Firebase configuration to connect to the local emulator.

## Solution 3: Update Your Authentication

If you prefer to keep the security rules as they are, make sure your application is properly authenticating users before attempting database operations.

1. Check that you're signed in before accessing Firestore
2. Verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions

## Production Security Rules

Before deploying to production, make sure to:

1. Uncomment the production rules in `firestore.rules`
2. Comment out or remove the development rule that allows all access
3. Deploy the updated rules:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-rules
   ```
