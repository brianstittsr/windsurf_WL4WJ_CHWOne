# GitHub Push Instructions for CHWOne Project

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Repository already initialized (which it is)

## Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub (if needed)
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "CHWOne")
4. Choose public or private visibility
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since your repo is already initialized)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub (if not already connected)
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CHWOne.git
```
Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Push Your Changes to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If you're prompted for credentials, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Generate a personal access token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
   - Select "repo" scope
   - Copy the generated token

2. When prompted for a password during push, use the token instead of your GitHub password

### 5. Using GitHub Desktop (Alternative)
If command line isn't working:
1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Add your local repository to GitHub Desktop
3. Publish the repository to GitHub

### 6. Verify Your Push
After pushing, visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your changes have been uploaded successfully.
