## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal presents a FOSS-Based AI-Enabled Citizen Service Management Platform (CSMP) designed to transform how the Ministry of Public Administration and Artificial Intelligence (MPAAI) delivers services to citizens. The platform leverages open-source technologies to create a modern, secure, and powerful system that aligns with MPAAI's goals of digital transformation, efficiency, and citizen-centricity.

Our CSMP solution offers:

- A unified platform for managing all citizen interactions across multiple channels
- AI-powered assistance for routing, case management, and citizen support
- Significant cost savings through elimination of proprietary licensing fees
- Complete technological sovereignty and freedom from vendor lock-in
- Scalable architecture that can grow with MPAAI's needs

**Important Note on Scope:** This proposal covers the design, development, and deployment of the CSMP application software. All costs are based on deploying the solution to MPAAI's existing secure government cloud environment. Infrastructure provisioning, compute resources, storage, networking, and hosting costs are the responsibility of MPAAI and are not included in this proposal.

*The CSMP implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that establishes the core platform capabilities and gradually expanding to include advanced AI features and integrations. The estimated timeline for MVP delivery is 32 weeks, with total software development and support costs that are approximately 60-70% lower than proprietary alternatives.*

*By implementing this CSMP solution, MPAAI will achieve:- Reduced processing time for citizen requests by up to 65%- Increased citizen satisfaction through consistent, omnichannel service delivery- Enhanced data-driven decision making through comprehensive analytics- Improved operational efficiency through workflow automation and AI assistance- Future-proof technology foundation that can evolve with changing citizen needs*
